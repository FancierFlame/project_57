            (I’m specifically talking about the OS and it’s sequels in this post, not the reboot)
When I ask myself this question, I’m actually unsure. I mean, Ben 10 is great. That’s all there is to it really. The main reasons are;

I like the various different aliens that get showcased. Some aliens get more screen time than others but there’s still a large variety. The Ben 10 universe is very big so there are lots of aliens. I also like that Ben and co started exploring the universe regularly. Like yass, show us this universe full of life.

Another factor as to why I love Ben 10 is the characters. Gwen, Ben, Kevin, Grandpa and Rook are all great characters in my eyes and they all add different things to the shows that make me like them more.

There’s also some great villains, imo. Some personal favourites are Vilgax from the OS, Albedo, Charmcaster, Morningstar and the Frog Princess. I love when a show has interesting villains. There are a few awful villains but let’s save that for another post (I’m coming for you, Nancy)

That’s it, lmao. I don’t know what else to say. I love aliens, I love the main cast and I love the villains (some of them).
